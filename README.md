# Mini RF Fire Fighting Robot

Welcome to the Mini RF Fire Fighting Robot project repository! This project involves creating a tracked mini robot that can extinguish small fires using a PS2 wireless RF remote control. The robot is equipped with a rear-end water supply system, and the nozzle's up-and-down movement is controlled via the remote.

## Overview

The Mini RF Fire Fighting Robot is a tracked robot designed to extinguish fires using a water supply system controlled by a PS2 wireless RF remote. The robot's nozzle, which dispenses water, can be adjusted up and down to direct the water stream. This robot does not include fire detection capabilities and is operated manually.

### Installing the Arduino Bootloader on a Custom Board

Using a custom board with an ATmega328P-AU microcontroller requires a few additional steps compared to using a standard Arduino Uno. Follow these steps to set up and program your custom board to control a servo motor:

#### 1. Prepare an Arduino as ISP

1. Use another Arduino board (like an Uno) as an ISP programmer.
2. Connect it to your computer and upload the "ArduinoISP" sketch from the Arduino IDE:
   - Go to **File > Examples > 11.ArduinoISP > ArduinoISP**.

#### 2. Connect the ISP Programmer

Connect the Arduino ISP to your custom board using jumper wires. Youâ€™ll need to connect:

- **MISO** (Pin 12 on the ISP) to **MISO** on the custom board
- **MOSI** (Pin 11 on the ISP) to **MOSI** on the custom board
- **SCK** (Pin 13 on the ISP) to **SCK** on the custom board
- **RESET** (Pin 10 on the ISP) to **RESET** on the custom board
- **VCC** (5V on the ISP) to **VCC** on the custom board
- **GND** (Ground on the ISP) to **GND** on the custom board

#### 3. Burn the Bootloader

1. In the Arduino IDE, go to **Tools > Board** and select "Arduino Uno" (since it uses the same microcontroller).
2. Go to **Tools > Programmer** and select "Arduino as ISP".
3. Click **Tools > Burn Bootloader**. This will upload the bootloader to your ATmega328P-AU.

## Arduino Code

The Arduino code controls the robot's water pump and nozzle movement based on input from the PS2 wireless RF remote. The code is located in the `main.ino` folder.
